The specifications that were derived from the consumer group through surveying are functionality, reliability, and safety. 
<br>
<br>Functionality is a characteristic that refers to the product not interfering with the normal operation of existing hardware that it interfaces with, e.g. the stove and the cell-phone. In the case of the stove-top notification system, functionality will be achieved if the product does not interfere with the normal operation of the user’s stovetop and cell. 
<br>
<br>Reliability refers to failure over the lifespan of the product. 
<br>
<br>Safety refers to the product not creating additional hazards to the user that are not already present in the operation of a stovetop and cell phone when the product is operated by the user in the manner intended and for the purpose intended by the manufacturer.
