	<b>Vicki May, Structural Engineer, Thayer School of Engineering Professor </b>
	<br>Pointed out the potential difficulties in changing window structure
	  <ul type="square">
	  <li>We solicited her opinion to assess the structural changes in the wall section that our design would entail and our concerns about the structural support of the window and sliding sheet</li>
	  <li>We would not compromise the stability of the wall or window. She suggested that as long as we were able to transfer the weight of the window to the two studs on either side by means of a bridge then there would be no building code or structural support issues</li>
	</ul>
<br>

	<b>Ryan Borkowski, Hanover Building Inspector<br>
	Jeff Andrews, Director of Hanover Planning and Zoning</b>
	<br>These gentlemen had extensive experience working with local and state building codes and with institutional commercial buildings.
	<ul type="square">
	<li>They found that the structural changes we were making to the wall section would not significantly hinder the operation of the wall or window</li>
	<li>The replacement of spray foam insulation with Polyiso and the addition of the solution would both meet and exceed New Hampshire Energy Code requirements by a significant margin.  In fact the R-19 requirement does not take into account window and wood spaces and considers only directly insulated areas, which in our design would have and R value of 40</li>
	<li>By having exposed polyiso as our sliding sheet component we would have issues with wear, moisture exposure and fire protection.  These three issues could be taken care of by covering the exterior of the polyiso sheet with a fire-retardant, water-resistant material of which there are several currently on the market.  This material would also allow us to customize the exterior finish of the solution to make it more attractive to potential customers</li>
