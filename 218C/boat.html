    Our design goal was to minimize material use, while giving us the ability to work with a bench-top prototyping platform. We used empty 2-liter soda bottles as our means of flotation.

    The soda bottles were latched to the boat frame by pipe clamps. A lightweight and malleable aluminum frame was constructed as the support frame and was secured with nuts and bolts. This construction method allowed for multiple design adjustments simply by drilling in new positions for components on the platform.
    <br>
    <br>
    To store our electrical components, we used tupperware containers which were lightweight and waterproof.

    Our final design used 4 parallel 2-liter bottles. This configuration reduced boat drag. The motors were placed in isolated "motor pods" mounted to the front of the boat. By putting the propellers at midship, we were able to rotate fully without lateral movement.
    <br>
    <br>
    The U-shaped mouth at the front of the boat helped stabilize the boat as it passed over a crab pot. The crab pot would fit within the mouth so that the RFID antennae could sit above the RFID card on the crab pot. This helped our players obtain an accurate read of card.

    This "motor pod" contains the TLE5206 motor driver chips (max 6A). A flexible couple was secured to the motor and to the drive shaft with a liquid connection compound. Since this compound was flexible, it was forgiving when the motor axle and shaft axle were slightly misaligned.

    Any breaches in the tupperware containers (especially the motor pod containers) were sealed with marine grade silicone. Wiring was run between tupperware pods inside clear tubing that was then sealed to the container. The motor shaft was protected by a 1 inch long shaft collar.
