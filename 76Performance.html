	<b>Performance</b>
	<br><br>
	The first round performance of the Flying Claw was good. We picked up three pucks and successfully crossed the moat to reach the treasure chest. Unfortunately, after the first round, the car began to experience difficulties. The drive train gearbox began to interface with the original drive train and was unable to move. 
<br>
<br>	The drive train had multiple problems. The first failure was due to a set screw coming loose on a shaft. The failure probably had its roots in the screw itself. The screw did not extend down far enough to fully contact the flat that we filed into the shaft, so the screw was able to work itself loose. We fixed this by attempting to lower the screw and then super gluing the gear to the shaft. The glue appeared to work surprisingly well. We then began to have issues with the way the gearbox was mounted to the car. The gearbox was not mounted to the same section of the car that the original gears were mounted in, so when the car’s body flexed the gears moved in and out of alignment. This was a particular problem when crossing the moat when the forces on that section were changing. The meshing of metric gears with English gears at two points in the gearbox compounded all of these issues.
<br>
<br>
	There were other problems with the car. The method of crossing the moat was not as robust as it could have been, which led to us having extra trouble with mobility. The crossing may have been easier with a reliable drive train, but it is impossible to know whether or not the design would have been successful if that had been the case. 
<br>
<br> 
	The strongest part of our design was our gripping mechanism. We used a claw attached to an arm that moved like a forklift. The arm was connected to a gearbox with a plastic chain. We found that the gearing ratio of the gearbox was large enough to allow the arm to completely lift the car, which allowed us to get out of situations that would otherwise have ended our round. The arm was also strong enough to lift as many pucks as we could grip with the gripping mechanism. The gripping mechanism itself was powered by a servo, and had enough gripping force to hold at least 7 pucks. The gripping mechanism could open wide enough to allow us to drive straight to the pucks without having to lift the arm over the stack. In addition to the point scoring uses of the arm, it ended up being very helpful as a crutch when the car was in an odd position. It allowed us to lift the front end, which helped us greatly.
<br>
<br>
	Overall we are happy with the design and performance of the point collecting mechanisms. Modifications and improvements are needed, however, for our drive train design. We think that we could have had a better performance if we had a more reliable method of moving around the playing field.
