</tr>

<tr>
<td>Size</td>
<td>Car was restricted to fit in the 18"x18" starting footprint. No height restrictions</td>
<td>Our car's overall length was 19.5 inches</td>
<td>By placing it diagonally, we were able to fit into the designated area</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Weight</td>
<td>Max allowed mass = 12kg</td>
<td>4.76kg. Original car weight was 1.5kg</td>
<td>We didn't exceed the maximum</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Mass that must be lifted</td>
<td>Our strategy was to pick up as many pucks as possible and cross the moat</td>
<td>Thermoform plastic part of claw could hold 10 pucks. After testing, we determined that the car could carry 5 pucks and safely cross the moat</td>
<td>If the car carried too much weight, the center of mass would be negatively affected especially when crossing the moat. We determined we could reasonably carry 5 pucks but during competition, we only grabbed 3 pucks.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Center of Mass</td>
<td>Should be near the center/back of the car. If too forward, the front would be too heavy and would dip while crossing the moat</td>
<td>Our car's center of mass was 4.9inches from the back tires. The middle of the car is 5.2 inches from the back tires.</td>
<td>This worked well during the first round of the competition while our car was in prime condition. However, in subsequent rounds, as the drive train started to fail and as we lost speed and secure control of the car, the car still ended up dipping into the moat and getting stuck.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Storage volume on machine</td>
<td>Similar to teh mass lifted requirements</td>
<td>Thermoform plastic claw built to carry 10.</td>
<td>It was possible to carry 10 pucks; reasonable to carry 5; safe ti carry 3.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Speed on car</td>
<td>Reduce speed to increase steering control</td>
<td>We geared our drive train down with a 72T and 32T gear for a final speed of 8.8ft/s</td>
<td>Some speed reduction is necessary to increase control, but too much reduction would hinder our moat crossing ability</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Speed of the arm</td>
<td>Reduce the speed of the arm to increase control of the claw</td>
<td>Geared it down to 0.152m/s</td>
<td>After construction and testing of the arm, we realized that the vertical motion still went faster than anticipated. If we weren't careful, the chain would pull too forcefully on the arm and could potentially break the chassis in half. Thus, we removed a few teeth from the rack. Without those teeth, the servo would still run, but the arm could not move any higher - this prevented catastrophic failure.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Height of the arm</td>
<td>Treasure chest wall is 4 inches high</td>
<td>We built our forklift arm to reach 5 inches</td>
<td>Very successful in depositing pucks into the treasure chest</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Locking the differential</td>
<td>Keep the wheels spinning when one wheel loses contact with the ground as the car crosses th moat</td>
<td>Locked only the back differentials</td>
<td>We had first locked both the front and back differentials. However, we had difficulty steering the car with both differentials locked. We decided to only lock the back</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Suspension</td>
<td>Maintain reasonable ground clearance with the added weight to teh car of the gearboxes, arm, and pucks</td>
<td>Added another spring to increase suspension by a factor of 4</td>
<td>The car's weight increased by a factor of 3. To maintain similar and stiffer suspension, we increased the suspension by 4.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Wings</td>
<td>Decrease tipping during moat crossing. Maintain stiffness in chassis body. Provide support while crossing the moat</td>
<td>14"x10" wing plate. Originally bent to keep the car up as it crossed the moat</td>
<td>First round, the designed wings worked very well. However, subsequent rounds showed that the car still dipped even as it crossed the moat, and the bent wing caused interference. After 3 rounds, we ended up flattening the wings to avoid striking the moat walls.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Widen the wheel base</td>
<td>Increase area of wheel contact during moat crossing</td>
<td>Widened each wheel base by 1 inch with brass rods</td>
<td>Effective in crossing the moat.</td>
</tr>
