	<font size=2> <b>Have you ever been driving in the car and suddenly your heart stops and you ask yourself, "Did I forget to turn off the stove? We have to turn back and check." </b></font>
	<p> Our group has. Many times. 
	<p> The current solution to this problem of driving back is not only time consuming, but the problem in itself is the cause of much stress and anxiety. This is
	no wonder since unattended stoves are the <b>#1 cause of household fires</b> in the U.S. According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, stovetops are associated with over 100,000 fires a year, causing 400 deaths annuatlly. 
	<p> We took this problem and focused on a solution to ease stove user's <b>peace of mind</b>.
	<p>
	<p> After conducting a number of customer surveys, quantifying the specifications with matrices to determine the best product, we decided that the main customer specs include: <b>Price, Safety, Size, & Ease of Use.</b>
	<p>
	<p> We then went about deciding the best way to solve this problem with these given specs.
	<br> Since we want to help as many stove users as possible, we decided to create a device that can be easily added to any existing stove (as the exchange rate for a new stove is about 14 yrs).
	 Then, since people obtain the most stress over their stoves when they are away from their homes, we wanted to establish a communication between the stove and user. Cell phones appeared to be the best solution.
