With this problem in mind, we propose to create a device that will allow for communication between the user and an electric stove via cell phone. The device will have a built-in timer which will signal a computer to dial the cell phone and play a message to the user, indicating whether the stove is on or off. The user can then press 1 to turn the stove off by shutting off the electricity to the appliance or 2 to turn the timer off and leave the stove on if they want to continue cooking their meal (i.e. stew which requires more time.)
<br>
<br>
The user will also be able to call in the stove at any time to check on the status of the stove and turn it off if necessary.
<br>
<br>The device will be an add-on and will be connected between the stove plug and the electric outlet. As a simple add-on that shuts off the electricity to the appliance, our device can potentially be applied to any electric-powered appliance. Users can then check the status of any appliance such as their air-conditioner, iron, or coffeemaker with their cell phone. This is exciting because it has huge market potential.
