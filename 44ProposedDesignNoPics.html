After evaluating our different options, we concluded that the solution best suited for our customers is to create an interior shade of Polyiso board that slides over the window. The sliding sheet will slide over the window at night and slide into the wall, either below or to the sides of the window depending on the building framing type when not in use.  We came up with designs for the three main building types.  Our prototype is the design for wood frame construction.  We then designed for metal frame construction, which is how most new commercial buildings are being constructed.  Finally we adapted our design to cavity wall construction. In this Proposed Design section, we will discuss our design for wood frame construction. We will describe additional designs in the Conceptual Alternatives Section.
<br>
<br>
For the wood frame construction, we started with the standard window framing for a 2x6 wall with wooden studs placed 16 inches apart, and made some small changes to accommodate our design. Below is a standard window design for stud frame construction published by the American Architectural Manufacturer Association.

<br>
<br>We decided to eliminate the middle stud below the window, turn the two studs below it parallel to the plane of the window, and replace the footer board with a 2x10 header in the plane of the window. The header would stand on its 2” side, giving us a 4” space to fit the Polyiso Board. Making these changes opened up a significant amount of room below the window where we could store the shade when not in use. We had our design reviewed by structural engineer and Dartmouth professor, Vicki May who agreed that our alterations to the standard window framing were structurally sound.  Below is a Pro-E drawing of the re-designed framing without the shade.

We then added tracks along the sides of this design and inserted the Polyiso shade into the tracks.  We placed a magnetic strip along the top of the Polyiso sheet to hold the shade up and create an air seal.  We used additional pieces of Polyiso to fill in all the gaps in the wood framing which resulted in a highly insulating wall section.  In the actual building of our design, more attention would need to be paid to the window jams and weather stripping around the window as well as the seal around the sliding sheet to minimize the amount of moisture that could get trapped between the sliding sheet and the window. In our built model, we used a single pane window. The following pictures show our final design for wood framing with the sliding sheet in place and display how the sheet moves.
