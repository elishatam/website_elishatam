<b>To cross the moat,</b> our main strategy was to widen the wheel base to increase ground contact. By driving across the moat at a 30? angle, we could safely cross, and only one wheel would lose contact with the ground. With the locked differential, the wheels would still rotate. The wings provided stiffness and prevented the car from driving down into the moat.
<br>
<br>  
<b>To carry the pucks and balls,</b> we built a forklift arm with an attached claw that could open and close around the pucks. We decided on a forklift arm because we had the necessary materials (rack, rack pinion, and servo) and it seemed to be the obvious choice. Designing the support to attach the arm to the car was more difficult and required more thought and analysis, but in the end, the arm was probably the most reliable part of our car.
To move the center of mass closer to the back of the car, we attached unused brass rods to the rear of the car.

    <td> 
Both claws were connected to a 32P, 32T gear.  These gears were driven by a 32P, 16T pinion gear that was connected to the servo. The resulting gear ratio was 2 to 1. Through testing, we found that the servo was capable of opening the claws by more than 90°. The servo was connected to the driving gear by a shaft and a connecting plate. Instead of slotting the plate and making a tab on the shaft, we instead drilled a hole in the connecting plate to fit the shaft. We secured this connection with a set screw. In order to fit the driving gear, the shaft had to be narrowed. Because of this it was necessary to construct a sleeve so the shaft could fit the bottom bearing. The ends of the plates were also rounded to prevent interference with the opening of the tube. The plates were also narrowed at the connection to the rack support, so we could maximize the depth of the claw extension.
