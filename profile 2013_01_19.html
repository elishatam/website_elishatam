            <br> Dartmouth '07, BA, Engineering Sciences and Studio Art
            <br> Stanford '11, MS, Mechanical Engineering
            <p> Hello there! I was born and raised in the Bay Area of California. I attended Dartmouth College
      in New Hampshire where I made many friends from around the US. Dartmouth opened the door for me to participate in a number of opportunities. I studied abroad in Beijing, traveled to New Orleans for a Jazz Festival with Dartmouth's 
      Gospel Choir, and worked with the Dartmouth community through the Dartmouth Asian Organization and as a Freshmen Orientation Leader.
            </p>

            <p> At Dartmouth, I majored in Engineering Sciences and Studio Art. I continued with my engineering education and obtained my Master's in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University. My concentration is in Mechatronics where I have learned to create cool electromechanical products.
            </p>

            <p>The people I've met through these activities have inspired me and made these experiences so memorable. I'm grateful for the friends I've made and I look forward to whatever may come next.
            </p>
