	<b>Problem Definition</b>
	<br><br>
	Busy, preoccupied stove users tend leave the house without confident knowledge of the status their stove-tops. Is it on or off? Later in the day, this can lead to much anxiety and stress. The user must either call a family member to check on the status, or in worst cases must return home to make sure it is off.  We are focusing to ease their peace of mind.

	<b>Magnitude</b>
	<ul type="square">
	  <li>Fires from unattended stoves accounted for <b>36%</b> of reported structure fires in 2002. In comparison, fires caused by heating = 18%, smoking = 3%</li>
	  <li>Cooking fires caused 185,600 fires in structures, 80 deaths, 3,875 injuries, and $481 million in property damage</li>
	  <li>Careless cooking activities were the contributing factors. Unattended equipment, such as people leaving food in the oven or on the stove or forgetting about it completely, accounted for 30% of cooking fires</li>

	 </ul>

<br>
	<b>Frequency</b>
	<ul type="square">
	  <li>Stovetops are the equipment most involved in cooking fires, causing 59% of all cooking fires</li>
	  <li>According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, stove-tops are associated with over 100,000 fires a year, causing 400 deaths annually. This means that at least one of every 100 stove-tops causes fire annually </li>

<br>
	<b>Ideal Purchaser and User</b>
	<ul type="square">
	  <li>The end user could potentially be any individual who owns an electric stove, but the target market will be busy, middle-class, working parents who own cell phones numbering 38.9 million in the US</li>
	  <li>The product design necessitates implementation on electric stoves, which, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, were used by nearly 65 percent of the 101,500,000 American households surveyed in 2001.  In 2003, the same survey found that roughly 60 percent of households used electricity for cooking fuel, down only a small percentage from two years prior</li>
